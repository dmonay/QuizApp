//EXPLANATIONS
        
var explanationArray = [];
explanationArray[0] = "For a whiskey to qualify as bourbon, the law--by international agreement--stipulates that it must be made in the USA. It must be made from at least 51% and no more than 79% Indian corn, and aged for at least two years.";
explanationArray[1] = "Peat is decomposed vegetable matter that covers a large part of Scotland. The barley malt is dried over a peat-heated fire and this is what imparts smokiness to the whiskey. The drying time of damp malt lies at approximately 30 hours.";
explanationArray[2] = "Chill filtering is a method for removing residue. In chill filtering, whisky is cooled to between -10° and 4° Celsius (often roughly 0°) and passed through a fine adsorption filter. Chill filtering prevents the whisky from becoming hazy when in the bottle, when served, when chilled, or when water or ice is added, as well as precluding sedimentation from occurring in the bottles. Such clouding only happens at an alcohol by volume of 46% or less, thus stronger bottled whisky is non-chill filtered or unchillfiltered.";
explanationArray[3] = "Malt is germinated cereal grains that have been dried in a process known as 'malting'. The grains are made to germinate by soaking in water, and are then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air. Malting grains develop the enzymes required to modify the grain's starches into sugars. The term 'malt' refers to several products of the process: the grains to which this process has been applied, for example malted barley; the sugar, heavy in maltose, derived from such grains, such as the baker's malt used in various cereals; or a product based on malted milk.";
explanationArray[4] = "When it comes to creating good bourbon, limestone is key, as iron-free water is filtered through these rocks before it’s used in the distillation. Kentucky produces more bourbon than anywhere else in the U.S, and it’s all thanks to this natural phenomenon. It seems nature loves bourbon as much as the rest of us!";
